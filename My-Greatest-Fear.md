<h1 align="center">my greast fear</h1>

my greatest ***fear*** is not being able to achieve my ***goals*** and that I let down ***myself**** , my family 
and others*** who want me to succesed.I want to meet my Parents **expectation** and i'm trying my best to be happy and successful in my personal and academic life, regardless of others want me be to succes, I still haven't find a way to overcome my fear.I still trying and I'm also afraid of public speaking, but I try to work on and trying was to fix that and I fear that I will die **alone** with nothing to show for it.But with all those fears, I still want overcome them and reach my goals.
